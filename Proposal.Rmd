# The motivation for this project


# The intended final products
Our project culminates in the creation of a comprehensive website serving as the central hub for all project-related information and tools. The website will feature:

 Homepage Overview: A welcoming homepage providing a succinct overview of the project. It will include essential information such as the project's objectives, motivation, the initial questions we aim to address, and a brief intro of our team members. Additionally, a screencast will offer visitors a guided tour of our project, encapsulating our journey from conception to realization.
Data Exploration: A dedicated section for our data sources and exploratory data analysis (EDA), offering insights into the foundational data that informs our research and models.

The website will also host a suite of interactive tools, visualizations and statistical models focusing on three key topics:
Geographical Analysis Tool: An interactive 'Shiny' application that maps the distribution of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients across the United States, allowing users to identify patterns and hotspots.
Risk Factor Analysis: We will develop statistical models to analyze the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's Disease, providing valuable insights into prevention and early detection strategies.
Clinical Trials analysis: Alzheimerâ€™s drug development pipeline. A spotlight on two recently released medications will give a further comparison of efficacy, side effects, and other critical metrics, empowering stakeholders with data-driven insights.
