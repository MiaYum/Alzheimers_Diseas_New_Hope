# The motivation for this project

Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder
affecting more than 6.5 million Americans that slowly destroys memory
and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple
tasks. However, existing drugs only treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s
disease. They do not treat the root cause of the disease and do not slow
down how quickly it gets worse. To date, there hasn’t been a new drug
approved for Alzheimer’s disease in 20 years. This year is an important
year for AD because a breakthrough occurs in AD treatment: two promising
drugs, Leqembi and Donanmab, for treating Alzheimer’s disease bring
fresh hope. Leqembi, the first treatment that shows an unequivocal
slowing of decline in Alzheimer’s disease, is fully approved by FDA in
July 2023. Donanemab is widely expected to be granted full FDA approval
within the next year. These two medications are both with impressive
Phase III clinical trial results. They represent an important
advancement in the ongoing fight to effectively treat Alzheimer’s
disease and could be the beginning of the end of Alzheimer’s disease.

# The intended final products

Our project culminates in the creation of a comprehensive website
serving as the central hub for all project-related information and
tools. The website will feature:

**Homepage Overview:** A welcoming homepage providing a succinct
overview of the project. It will include essential information such as
the project’s objectives, motivation, the initial questions we aim to
address, and a brief intro of our team members. Additionally, a
screencast will offer visitors a guided tour of our project,
encapsulating our journey from conception to realization.

**Data Exploration:** A dedicated section for our data sources and
exploratory data analysis (EDA), offering insights into the foundational
data that informs our research and models.

The website will also host a suite of interactive tools, visualizations
and statistical models focusing on three key topics:

**Geographical Analysis Tool:** An interactive ‘Shiny’ application that
maps the distribution of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients across the
United States, allowing users to identify patterns and hotspots.

**Risk Factor Analysis:** We will develop statistical models to analyze
the risk factors associated with Alzheimer’s Disease, providing valuable
insights into prevention and early detection strategies.

**Clinical Trials analysis:** Alzheimer’s drug development pipeline. A
spotlight on two recently released medications will give a further
comparison of efficacy, side effects, and other critical metrics,
empowering stakeholders with data-driven insights.

# The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

In this project, we aim to comprehensively analyze the landscape of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients in the United States.

Part 1 involves mapping the geographical distribution of AD patients
across the country using R packages such as ggplot and leaflet.

In Part 2, we will employ data manipulation and analysis tools like
tidyverse, MASS, and various statistical methods including principal
component analysis, cluster analysis, and regression modeling to
identify key factors contributing to the disease’s onset, such as age,
gender, and ethnicity.

Finally, in Part 3, we will perform a comparative analysis of two
recently released drugs targeting Alzheimer’s disease, utilizing
visualization packages like ggplot2 and plotly to create informative
charts and graphics that illustrate the effectiveness and specificity of
these medications.
