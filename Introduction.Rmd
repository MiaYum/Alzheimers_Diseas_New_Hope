# Motivation and Background [Finish]

In the quiet twilight of memory, where the essence of a person’s life - their joys, sorrows, and triumphs - slowly dims, lies the profound tragedy of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s a realm where the familiar contours of identity are relentlessly eroded, not by the passage of time, but by an insidious ailment that disassembles the core of who they are. Each forgotten name, each lost memory, is a star winking out in the galaxy of a person’s life story, leaving behind a haunting void where once there was a rich tapestry of experiences and connections.

Alzheimer's, an irreversible brain disorder, affects over 6 million Americans, progressively destroying memory and cognitive skills. Current treatments only address symptoms, not the disease's root cause or the progression. To date, there hasn’t been a new drug approved for Alzheimer’s disease in 20 years.

2023 marks a pivotal year in Alzheimer's research with the breakthrough of two promising drugs, Leqembi (Lecanemab) and Donanemab. Leqembi, the first drug to show a definitive slowing of Alzheimer's decline, received FDA approval in July 2023. Donanemab, with its impressive Phase III clinical trial results, is on the cusp of FDA approval. These drugs symbolize a significant leap forward in treating Alzheimer's, potentially heralding the beginning of the end for this devastating disease.

Our project is driven by the desire to deeply understand Alzheimer's disease in its entirety - its distribution, associated factors, and the transformative potential of these new drugs. We aim to explore how these advancements might alter the course of Alzheimer's.

The alarming statistics presented in the Alzheimer's Association's ["Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures 2023"](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures) report paint a stark picture of the escalating impact of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. Currently, over 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, a number projected to nearly double to around 13 million by 2050. This disease not only poses a significant health challenge but also has a profound societal and economic impact. It is a leading cause of death, with one in three seniors dying with Alzheimer's or another form of dementia, surpassing the fatalities from breast and prostate cancer combined.

The intricate relationship between Alzheimer's Disease and various risk factors forms the cornerstone of our research. [Existing studies](https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/non-genetic-risk-factors/) have illuminated several key elements that contribute to the development of this complex neurological disorder. (1) Age-related changes in the brain, such as neuron degeneration and the development of protein tangles and plaques, play a crucial role. (2) Education level emerges as another influential factor. Educational attainment appears to offer some protection, potentially creating a "neural reserve" through denser synaptic networks. (3) Cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure and cholesterol, mirror their impact on heart health in their potential to increase Alzheimer's risk. (4) Diabetes, another significant factor, is under investigation for its link to cognitive decline, with implications for the growing diabetic population. (5) Socioeconomic factors such as income, healthcare expenditure, and price index play a subtle yet impactful role. They influence lifestyle choices and access to healthcare resources, which in turn can affect Alzheimer's risk.

In the dynamic landscape of Alzheimer's disease research, ClinicalTrials.gov stands as a comprehensive repository, detailing ongoing clinical trials . Furthermore, Phase III clinical trials of two latest promising drugs Lecanemab and Donanemab were extensively documented in journal articles, have garnered significant attention for their in-depth investigation. 

# Initial Question [Finish]

From the available data we are interested in answering the following questions:

*   Regarding Alzheimer Facts and Influencing Factors

    *   How does the distribution and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease vary across the United States, and what are the key factors influencing these patterns? This question guides our exploration and visualization of the geographical trends and variances in Alzheimer's cases, along with an in-depth analysis of the socioeconomic and healthcare-related factors that may impact these distributions.

    *   How can our data science models predict future trends in Alzheimer's cases across different states, and how might these predictions inform targeted interventions and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of Alzheimer's disease?

*   Regarding Pipeline and Clinical Trials of New Alzheimer Drugs

    *   How can we provide a comprehensive and detailed overview of the current Alzheimer's drug trials in the U.S., encompassing their stages, approaches, and geographical distribution?

    *   How do Lecanemab and Donanemab, the newly FDA-approved Alzheimer's drugs, compare in terms of their development, efficacy, and potential impact?
    
# Goals [ongoing]

In the realm of clinical research, particularly for Alzheimer's disease, the availability and accessibility of trial information are crucial for researchers, clinicians, and the general public. While resources like ClinicalTrials.gov provide extensive details on ongoing clinical trials, their complexity and format can be daunting, especially for those new to navigating such databases. Recognizing this gap, one of our primary goals is to develop a user-friendly visualization and interaction tool. This tool aims to transform the way information from ClinicalTrials.gov is accessed and understood, making it more approachable and comprehensible for beginners and non-specialists.
