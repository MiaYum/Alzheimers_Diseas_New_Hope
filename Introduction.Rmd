In the quiet twilight of memory, where the essence of a person’s life - their joys, sorrows, and triumphs - slowly dims, lies the profound tragedy of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s a realm where the familiar contours of identity are relentlessly eroded, not by the passage of time, but by an insidious ailment that disassembles the core of who they are. Each forgotten name, each lost memory, is a star winking out in the galaxy of a person’s life story, leaving behind a haunting void where once there was a rich tapestry of experiences and connections.

# Motivation

Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder affecting more than 6 million Americans that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple tasks. However, existing drugs only treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. They do not treat the root cause of the disease and do not slow down how quickly it gets worse. To date, there hasn’t been a new drug approved for Alzheimer’s disease in 20 years. 

2023 is an important year for AD because a breakthrough occurs in AD treatment: two promising drugs, Leqembi and Donanemab, for treating Alzheimer's disease bring fresh hope. Leqembi, the first treatment that shows an unequivocal slowing of decline in Alzheimer’s disease, was fully approved by the FDA in July 2023. Donanemab is widely expected to be granted full FDA approval within the next year. These two medications are both with impressive Phase III clinical trial results. They represent an important advancement in the ongoing fight to effectively treat Alzheimer’s disease and could be the beginning of the end of Alzheimer's disease. 

Our project is driven by the desire to deeply understand Alzheimer's disease in its entirety - its distribution, associated factors, and the transformative potential of these new drugs. We aim to explore how these advancements might alter the course of Alzheimer's disease.

The ["Alzheimer's Disease Facts and Figures 2023"](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures) report from the Alzheimer's Association reveals the growing prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States. Over 6 million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's, with projections suggesting this number could rise to about 13 million by 2050. This disease, a leading cause of death among seniors, has significant health, societal, and economic impacts, with mortality rates exceeding those of breast and prostate cancer combined.

Our research focuses on the complex relationship between Alzheimer's Disease and its risk factors as highlighted in [existing studies](https://www.alzinfo.org/articles/non-genetic-risk-factors/) of Alzheimer. Key elements include: (1) Age-related brain changes like neuron degeneration and protein build-up; (2) Educational attainment, potentially offering neural protection; (3) Cardiovascular risk factors akin to heart health impacting Alzheimer's risk; (4) The link between diabetes and cognitive decline; (5) Socioeconomic factors influencing lifestyle and healthcare access, thereby affecting Alzheimer's risk.

In the dynamic landscape of Alzheimer's disease research, [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Alzheimer) stands as a comprehensive repository, detailing ongoing clinical trials. Furthermore, Phase III clinical trials of the two latest promising drugs Lecanemab and Donanemab were extensively documented in journal articles, and have garnered significant attention for their in-depth investigation. 

# Initial Question

From the available data we are interested in answering the following questions:

*   Regarding Alzheimer Facts and Influencing Factors

    *   How does the distribution and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease vary across the United States, and what are the key factors influencing these patterns?

    *   How can our data science models predict future trends in mortality rates of Alzheimer’s patients across different states, and how might these predictions inform targeted interventions and resource allocation to mitigate the impact of Alzheimer's disease?

*   Regarding Pipeline and Clinical Trials of New Alzheimer Drugs

    *   How can we provide a comprehensive and detailed overview of the current Alzheimer's drug trials in the U.S., encompassing their stages, approaches, and geographical distribution?

    *   How do Lecanemab and Donanemab, the newly FDA-approved Alzheimer's drugs, compare in terms of their development, efficacy, and potential impact?
    
# Goals

*   Explore and develop an interactive visualization tool of the geographical distributions and trends in Alzheimer's associated factors across the US.

*   In-depth analysis of associated factors (including socioeconomic, healthcare-related factors, etc.) that may impact the distribution of AD death rate. We will develop regression and random forest models. These models will not only aid in predicting AD death rates with greater accuracy but also enable us to delve deeper into the significance and influence of each variable.

*   The availability and accessibility of trial information are crucial for researchers, clinicians, and the general public to learn more about Alzheimer's Disease. While resources like ClinicalTrials.gov provide extensive details on ongoing clinical trials, their complexity and format can be daunting, especially for those new to navigating such databases. Recognizing this gap, one of our primary goals is to develop a user-friendly visualization and interaction shiny tool to show the geographic distirbution of clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov.

*   Presentation and comparison of Phase III clinical trial results for two latest Alzheimer's drugs, Lecanemab and Donanemab. We focus on their efficacy, safety profiles, and overall impact on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and aim to provide a clear and easy to understand comparison between these two groundbreaking treatments.
