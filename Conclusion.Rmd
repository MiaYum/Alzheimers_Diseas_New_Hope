# Findings and Conclusion

In our study, we integrated and cleaned data from different data sets, discovering some missing entries. 

For exploratory analysis, we categorized predictive variables into social and health factors. We also addressed multicollinearity and identified potential nonlinear relationships with the death rate. 

After preliminary analysis, we discovered that the examination of Alzheimer's Disease mortality rates across different regions in the United States revealed significant disparities, with the South region having the highest and the Northeast region having the lowest average death rates. There are also significant variations in Alzheimer's Disease death rates based on income and employment groups, indicating that socioeconomic factors play a role in disease outcomes.

Next, we tried to generate a regression model. Initially, we generated a multiple linear regression model and the performance is not good enough but further indicate nonlinear variable relationships. This led us to employ a random forest regression model, which significantly enhanced the model fit, raising R squared from 0.4 to 0.9.

Analysis of variable importance revealed a strong correlation between education level and mortality rates in Alzheimer's patients, with healthcare expenditure as the second most influential factor. Other factors, including smoking rate, elderly population proportion, employment, income, and cardiovascular rate, were less significant. These results highlight the complex interplay of socioeconomic, lifestyle, and healthcare factors in Alzheimer's patient outcomes.

We also developed a visualization tool to provide a comprehensive overview of Alzheimer's drug trials across the United States, enhancing the understanding of Alzheimer's disease treatment landscape. Building on this foundation, we conducted a focused evaluation of the treatment efficacy and safety of two latest drugs, Lecanemab and Donanemab. Our findings reveal that while both drugs show promise of efficacy, they also share key side effects, notably infusion-related reactions, ARIA, and headaches.

# Challenges

We encountered several challenges throughout the study. One of the primary issues pertained to the data itself, particularly the difficulty of accessing some crucial data and absence of categorical variables like income level and employment status, which could have provided a clearer division of variables. To address this, we established our own criteria for categorizing these variables into different groups.

During the preliminary analysis part, the analysis faced challenges in addressing the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's Disease data, particularly regarding death rates across regions. Variability in data sources, reporting mechanisms, and population characteristics may introduce uncertainties. Additionally, assumptions of normality in the t-test and homogeneity of variances in the ANOVA test may be influenced by outliers or non-normal distributions, posing challenges to the robustness of statistical inferences.

During the EDA part , we found strong correlations among multiple variables, necessitating the removal of some for regression modeling. The selection process involved intense discussion, ultimately leading to the choice of representative variables based on facts and data characteristics. Initially, our linear model performed poorly, prompting us to shift to a black-box model, which significantly improved the fit.

# Limitations and Further Improvements

Our analysis, spanning from 2018 to 2021, provides a snapshot of Alzheimer's Disease death rates over this period. However, it's important to note that this four-year timeframe may not fully capture the variations and trends over a longer period. The limited data volume from this duration could potentially restrict the generalizability of our model's findings and a more extended analysis, encompassing long-term trends, would likely offer a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing Alzheimer's Disease mortality rates.

The heteroscedasticity observed in our analysis indicates that there is a varying degree of variability in Alzheimer's Disease death rates across different regions and characteristics. This finding suggests that healthcare policies and interventions need to be tailored to account for these regional disparities in death rates. Future research should aim to further investigae the practical significance of these variations and uncover the underlying mechanisms driving them.

In the future, there's potential for research at an individual level, rather than state level, which could yield more granular insights while such an approach would pose significant challenges in data collection and privacy considerations.
