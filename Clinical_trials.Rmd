# Clinical Trials Pipeline

In our quest to deepen the understanding of Alzheimer's disease and its treatment landscape, we have developed an innovative Shiny application designed to visualize the clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs across the United States. This interactive tool is a significant stride in making complex trial data accessible, which labels all trials on the map and has regional statistics based on zoom size. The following screenshot offers a glimpse into the app's capabilities, and the full dashboard can be accessed [here].

# Trials comparison

We further evaluate and compare the performance of the two latest promising drugs Lecanemab and Donanemab for their participants' characteristics, treatment efficacy, and adverse events.

* From the plot, we can see that there are more female participants in Donanemab's clinical trial that in Lecanemab's clinical trial.


* From the plot, we can also see there is more diversity in  Lecanemab's clinical trial. Races other than white occupy a larger proportion of participants in Lecanemab's clinical trial than in Donanemab's clinical trial than that in Lecanemab's clinical trial, especially Asians.

All trials participants took Alzheimer's tests to evaluate their stages at the start of study. CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes), ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale) and MMSE (Mini-mental state examination) were shown in the plot, details of theses test scores were explained in next part.

## Treatment evaluation

The evaluated outcomes encompassed measures such as CDR-SB (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes), ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale), and various other clinical assessments. These metrics collectively offer valuable insights into the effectiveness of donanemab in comparison to the placebo, shedding light on its impact on slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease over the 76-week (18 months) trial period.

In the trial of Donanemab, participants were categorized into two groups based on tau biomarker levels in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): those with low/medium tau (mild cognitive impairment or early Alzheimer's with lower tau levels) and those with high tau (early Alzheimer's with higher tau levels). Additionally, a combined population included all trial participants, irrespective of tau levels. This stratification aimed to evaluate the efficacy of donanemab across different Alzheimer's patient subgroups.

### CDR-SB

The Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) is a widely used assessment tool for evaluating the severity of dementia. It is a composite score derived from the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, which is used to assess the cognitive and functional abilities of individuals with dementia.

The CDR-SB incorporates ratings across six domains: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain is rated on a scale from 0 (no impairment) to 3 (severe impairment), and the total CDR-SB score ranges from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater clinical impairment.

```{r}
Don_CDR_SB = read_excel("data/Donanemab.xlsx", sheet = "result") |>
  filter(outcome == "CDR-SB",
         str_detect(group, "combined"))

Lec_CDR_SB = read_excel("data/Lecanemab.xlsx", sheet = "result") |>
  filter(outcome == "CDR-SB")

CDR_SB_merge = bind_rows(Don_CDR_SB, Lec_CDR_SB) |>
  mutate(group = case_match(
    group,
    "Donanemab-combined" ~ "Donanemab-combined",
    "Placebo-combined" ~ "Donanemab Placebo-combined",
    "Lecanemab" ~ "Lecanemab",
    "Placebo" ~ "Lecanemab Placebo"))

ggplot(CDR_SB_merge, aes(x = as.factor(time), y = mean, fill = group, color = group)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.25) +
  labs(title = "Mean with 95% CI over Time (CDR-SB)",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Mean") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

* The trial results demonstrated that both treatments slows the clinical progression of Alzheimer compared to their placebo as measured by the CDR-SB, indicating its potential efficacy in addressing the symptoms and functional decline associated with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab shows adjusted mean change of 1.21 from baseline to endpoint, while Donanemab shows 1.16 (95%CI: 0.97-1.35) least square mean change.

### ADAS-Cog

The ADAS-Cog, a primary cognitive outcome measure mandated by the FDA for Alzheimer's drug trials in the U.S., assesses language, memory, praxis, and orientation. This test, taking 30-35 minutes, scores from 0-70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.

```{r}
Don_ADAS_Cog  = read_excel("data/Donanemab.xlsx", sheet = "result") |>
  filter(outcome == "ADAS-Cog13")

Lec_ADAS_Cog = read_excel("data/Lecanemab.xlsx", sheet = "result") |>
  filter(outcome == "ADAS-Cog14")

ADAS_Cog_merge = bind_rows(Don_ADAS_Cog, Lec_ADAS_Cog) |>
  mutate(group = case_match(
    group,
    "Donanemab-combined" ~ "Donanemab (combined)",
    "Placebo-combined" ~ "Donanemab Placebo (combined)",
    "Lecanemab" ~ "Lecanemab",
    "Placebo" ~ "Lecanemab Placebo",
    "Donanemab-Low/medium tau" ~ "Donanemab (Low/medium tau)",
    "Placebo-Low/medium tau" ~ "Donanemab Placebo (Low/medium tau)"))

ggplot(ADAS_Cog_merge, aes(x = as.factor(time), y = mean, fill = group, color = group)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.25) +
  labs(title = "Mean with 95% CI over Time (ADAS-Cog)",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Mean") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

* A more pronounced reduction in the mean change from baseline to endpoint in the treatment group, as compared to the placebo, was observed for both Lecanemab (4.14 adjusted mean change) and Donanemab (3.17 LSM for low/medium tau, 5.46 LSM for combined). This suggests a potential positive impact of these drugs on cognitive function in Alzheimer's patients, with varying efficacy across different stages of the disease.

## Survival Analysis

The Phase III trials of Lecanemab and Donanemab both use cumulative hazard ratio to indicate the risk of progression assessed using CDR-SB score. The hazard plot for Donanemab is as following

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Don_KM = 
  read_excel("./Data/Donanemab.xlsx", sheet = "K-M", range = "A1:D16") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

plot_ly(Don_KM |>
                 filter(test == "CDR-SB") |>
                 pivot_longer(
                   donanemab:placebo,
                   names_to = "drug",
                   values_to = "ratio"
                 ), x = ~time, y = ~ratio, color = ~drug, line = list(shape = "hv"), colors = "viridis") |>
  layout(title = "Hazard Plot for Donanemab",
             xaxis = list(title = "Days from First Infusion"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Percentage of Participants Progression"))
```

* The hazard ratio for the combined group of Donanemab was found to be 0.623 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.519 to 0.748, indicating a significant reduction in the risk associated with the progression of Alzheimer's disease as measured by the CDR-SB score. In comparison, Lecanemab demonstrated a hazard ratio of 0.69, also suggesting a reduced risk, albeit to a slightly lesser extent than Donanemab. These results indicate that both drugs are effective in slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease, with Donanemab showing a marginally higher efficacy in this regard.

## Adverse Events

### General Overview

As we progress in our comprehensive exploration of Alzheimer's disease and its treatment options, we now turn our focus to a critical aspect of drug evaluation: the analysis of adverse events associated with the two promising drugs.

```{r}
lec_safety = read_excel("./Data/Lecanemab.xlsx", sheet = "safety", range = "A1:C5") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

don_safety = read_excel("./Data/Donanemab.xlsx", sheet = "safety", range = "A1:C5") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

merge_safety = left_join(lec_safety, don_safety, by = "events")
```

```{r}
plot_ly(merge_safety |>
  mutate(events = fct_reorder(events, -lecanemab)) |>
  pivot_longer(
    lecanemab:donanemab_placebo,
    names_to = "drug",
    values_to = "cases"
  ), 
  x = ~events, y = ~cases, color = ~drug, type = 'bar', colors = "viridis")  |>
  layout(title = "Barplot for Adverse Events",
             xaxis = list(title = "Adverse Event"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Number of participants"))
```

* The Lecanemab group experienced a 0.7% death rate (6 cases) compared to 0.8% (7 cases) in the placebo group, with no deaths linked to Lecanemab or ARIA. Serious adverse events were slightly higher in the Lecanemab group at 14.0% (126 cases) versus 11.3% (101 cases) in the placebo. 

* For Donanemab, the death rate was 1.9% (16 cases) in the treatment group against 1.1% (10 cases) in the placebo, with serious adverse events at 17.4% (148 cases) for Donanemab and 15.8% (138 cases) for the placebo. These results suggest a similar safety profile for both drugs compared to their respective placebo groups.

```{r}
safety_test = function(a, b, c, d, n1, n2){
  RD = round(a/n1 - b/n2, 4)
  RR = round((a/n1)/(b/n2), 4)
  OR = round((a*d)/(b*c), 4)
  Chis = round(prop.test(x = c(a, b), n = c(c, d), alternative = "two.sided", correct = FALSE)$statistic, 4)
  p_value = round(prop.test(x = c(a, b), n = c(n1, n2), alternative = "two.sided", correct = FALSE)$p.value, 6)
  return (tibble(Risk_Diff = RD, Risk_Ratio = RR, Odds_Ratio = OR, Xsquared = Chis, P.value = p_value))
  }
```

```{r}
lec_safety_test = safety_test(126, 101, 772, 796, 898, 897)
don_safety_test = safety_test(148, 138, 705, 736, 853, 874)
comp_safety_test = safety_test(126, 148, 772, 705, 898, 853)
safety_merge = bind_rows(lec_safety_test, don_safety_test, comp_safety_test) |>
  mutate(Test = c("Lec vs Placebo", "Don vs Placebo", "Lec vs Don")) |>
  select(Test, everything())

kable(safety_merge)
```

In our statistical analysis of serious adverse events associated with Lecanemab, Donanemab, and their placebos, we have identified key findings. With a significance level set at 0.1, our results indicate a significant difference in serious adverse events between Lecanemab and its placebo, suggesting a higher risk associated with Lecanemab. In contrast, Donanemab did not show a significant difference in serious adverse events compared to its placebo, implying a potentially safer profile. Additionally, a significant difference was observed between Lecanemab and Donanemab, highlighting distinct safety profiles for these drugs.

Then, we further investigate the differences of specific adverse events for two drugs.

```{r}
lec_ae = read_excel("./Data/Lecanemab.xlsx", sheet = "AE", range = "A1:C10") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

don_ae = read_excel("./Data/Donanemab.xlsx", sheet = "AE", range = "A1:C10") |>
  janitor::clean_names()

merge_ae = left_join(lec_ae, don_ae, by = "ae")
```

```{r}
plot_ly(merge_ae |>
  mutate(ae = fct_reorder(ae, donanemab)) |>
  pivot_longer(
    lecanemab:donanemab_placebo,
    names_to = "drug",
    values_to = "cases"
  ), 
  x = ~ae, y = ~cases, color = ~drug, type = 'bar', colors = "viridis")  |>
  layout(title = "Barplot for Adverse Events",
             xaxis = list(title = "Adverse Event"),
             yaxis = list(title = "Number of participants"))
```

The barplot clearly shows notable differences in specific adverse events (such as Infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E/ARIA-H, Urinary tract infections, and Headaches) between the treatment and placebo groups. To further evaluate and quantify these observed differences, we will proceed with a detailed statistical tests to provide a more definitive understanding of the significance of these adverse events.

### Lecanemab vs Placebo

```{r}
# test = lec_ae |>
#   mutate(p = lecanemab_placebo/sum(lecanemab_placebo))
# chisq.test(test$lecanemab, p = test$p, correct = FALSE) \
lec_ae_result = lec_ae |>
  mutate(testresult = map2(lecanemab, lecanemab_placebo, \(a, b) safety_test(a, b, 898-a, 897-b, 898, 897))) |>
  rename(Adverse_Effect = ae) |>
  unnest(testresult) |>
  select(-lecanemab, -lecanemab_placebo)

kable(lec_ae_result)
```

* The statistical tests reveals significant differences in the incidence of infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E/ARIA-H, and headaches between the Lecanemab and placebo groups. These findings are consistent with the most common side effects listed on the Lecanemab website, validating our results. This highlights the need for careful monitoring of these specific adverse events when considering Lecanemab for Alzheimer's treatment, ensuring informed decision-making and optimized patient care.

### Donanemab vs Placebo

```{r}
# test = don_ae |>
#   mutate(p = donanemab_placebo/sum(donanemab_placebo))
# chisq.test(test$donanemab, p = test$p, correct = FALSE)

don_ae_result = don_ae |>
  mutate(testresult = map2(donanemab, donanemab_placebo, \(a, b) safety_test(a, b, 853-a, 874-b, 853, 874))) |>
  rename(Adverse_Effect = ae) |>
  unnest(testresult) |>
  select(-donanemab, -donanemab_placebo)

kable(don_ae_result)
```

* The test for comparing Donanemab and its placebo group has similarly identified significant differences in the occurrence of infusion-related reactions, ARIA-E/ARIA-H, and headaches. This parallel finding with Donanemab, mirroring the results observed with Lecanemab, underscores the importance of these specific adverse events in the context of Alzheimer's disease treatments.

### Lecanemab vs Donanemab

```{r}
# test = don_ae |>
#   mutate(p = donanemab_placebo/sum(donanemab_placebo))
# chisq.test(lec_ae$lecanemab, p = test$p, correct = FALSE) 
com_ae =  don_ae |>
  mutate(lecanemab = lec_ae$lecanemab) |>
  select(-donanemab_placebo)

com_ae_test = com_ae |>
  mutate(testresult = map2(lecanemab, donanemab, \(a, b) safety_test(a, b, 898-a, 853-b, 898, 853))) |>
  rename(Adverse_Effect = ae) |>
  unnest(testresult) |>
  select(-donanemab, -lecanemab) |>
  filter(P.value < 0.05)

kable(com_ae_test)
```

* In our comparative analysis of Lecanemab and Donanemab, we found notable differences in specific adverse events. Lecanemab showed a higher proportion of infusion-related reactions and urinary tract infections, while Donanemab exhibited a higher incidence of ARIA-E. These results highlight the distinct safety profiles of each drug, emphasizing the need for tailored monitoring strategies based on the unique risks associated with each treatment in managing Alzheimer's disease.

```{r}
Don_result <- read_excel("data/Donanemab.xlsx", sheet = "result")

# Appendix


### MMSE
The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a widely used screening tool for cognitive impairment and is often employed in clinical and research settings to assess cognitive function, particularly in the context of dementia. The MMSE evaluates various cognitive domains, including orientation, memory, attention, language, and visuospatial abilities.

```{r}
MMSE <- read_excel("data/Donanemab_.xlsx", sheet = "5")

ggplot(MMSE, aes(x = as.factor(time), y = mean, fill = group, color = group)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.25) +
  facet_wrap(~outcome, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Mean with 95% CI over Time",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Mean") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The MMSE scores provide information about the cognitive function of the participants in the study.  The mean scores and standard deviations can be used to compare the cognitive performance of the donanemab group and the placebo group.  A higher mean score in the donanemab group compared to the placebo group would suggest a potential positive effect of donanemab on cognitive function.


### iADRS
The Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) is a comprehensive assessment tool used to measure the progression of Alzheimer's disease. It combines the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog13) with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study—Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL). By integrating these measures, the iADRS provides a holistic evaluation of both cognitive function and daily living activities in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

```{r}
iADRS <- read_excel("data/Donanemab_.xlsx", sheet = "1")

ggplot(iADRS, aes(x = as.factor(time), y = mean, fill = group, color = group)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.25) +
  facet_wrap(~outcome, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Mean with 95% CI over Time",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Mean") +
  theme_minimal()
```

The results show that treatment with donanemab resulted in a statistically significant slowing of clinical progression compared to placebo in both the low/medium tau and combined populations. 


### ADCS-iADL
The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study—Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-iADL) is a measurement tool used to assess the functional abilities of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It is designed to evaluate a person's capacity to perform various instrumental activities of daily living, such as managing finances, using the telephone, shopping, preparing meals, doing housework, and managing medications.

The ADCS-iADL scale provides a structured assessment of a person's functional independence and is particularly relevant for evaluating the impact of Alzheimer's disease on daily activities beyond basic self-care tasks. The scale typically ranges from 0 to 59, with lower scores indicating greater impairment in instrumental activities of daily living.

```{r}
ADCS_iADL <- read_excel("data/Donanemab_.xlsx", sheet = "3")

ggplot(ADCS_iADL, aes(x = as.factor(time), y = mean, fill = group, color = group)) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(0.9), size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.25) +
  facet_wrap(~outcome, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Mean with 95% CI over Time",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Mean") +
