# Clinical Trials Pipeline
In our quest to deepen the understanding of Alzheimer's disease and its treatment landscape, we have developed an innovative Shiny application designed to visualize the clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs across the United States. This interactive tool is a significant stride in making complex trial data accessible, which label all trials on the map and have regional statistics based on zoom size. The following screenshot offers a glimpse into the app's capabilities, and the full dashboard can be accessed [here].
